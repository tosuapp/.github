Heya! We're doin tosu!
---
What is it? A powerful memory reader for one cool rhythm-game that you probably play anyway, if you came here. You can use it to make a cool and beautiful overlay for your game. We provide an extensive api that contains a lot of information from the game memory. For example, you can make an overlay for a stream (you can see examples from Sotarks, mrekk, BTMC), and you can also use an in-game overlay if you want to know in real time how much pp a certain beatmap will give!

If you want to help us develop, we accept almost all pool requests that are aimed at adding features/fixing problems!
